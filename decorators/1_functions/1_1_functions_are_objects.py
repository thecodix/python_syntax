"""
To understand decorators, you must first understand that functions are objects in Python.
This has important consequences. Letâ€™s see why with a simple example
"""


def shout(word="yes"):
    return word.capitalize() + "!"

print(shout())
# outputs : 'Yes!'

# As an object, you can assign the function to a variable like any other object
scream = shout

# Notice we don't use parentheses: we are not calling the function,
# we are putting the function "shout" into the variable "scream".
# It means you can then call "shout" from "scream":

print(scream())
# outputs : 'Yes!'

# More than that, it means you can remove the old name 'shout',
# and the function will still be accessible from 'scream'

del shout
try:
    print(shout())
except NameError as e:
    print(e)
    # outputs: "name 'shout' is not defined"

print(scream())
# outputs: 'Yes!'
